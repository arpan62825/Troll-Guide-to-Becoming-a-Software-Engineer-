        <h3>Step 1: Buy a Hoodie</h3>
        <p>
          All great engineers wear hoodies. It's a proven fact. Just ask
          Zuckerberg! This is your first step to fitting in at every tech
          meetup. Pro tip: the darker the hoodie, the more mysterious and
          knowledgeable you appear.

        <h3>Step 2: Learn a Programming Language</h3>
        <p>
          Choose the most popular language today... which will probably be
          obsolete by next year anyway. Start with something trendy, like
          JavaScript, and master the art of console.log('Hello World'). Now
          you‚Äôre officially a developer!

        <h3>Step 3: Copy-Paste from Stack Overflow</h3>
        <p>
          If you're not copying code, are you even a real programmer? 90% of
          programming is finding the right answer on Stack Overflow and hoping
          it works. Just remember to change the variable names so it looks
          original.
        </p>

      <article class="step">
        <h3>Step 4: Name Your First Project 'Untitled'</h3>
        <p>
          Nothing screams 'professional' like a dozen files named 'Untitled1',
          'Untitled2', etc. Naming things is hard, so why bother? Just make sure
          to eventually rename them when your boss asks what‚Äôs what.

        <h3>Step 5: Create a GitHub Account and Never Use It</h3>
        <p>
          Open-source contributions? Pfft, who has time for that? Create a
          GitHub account, fork a couple of repositories, and call it a day. Your
          activity graph is basically modern art.

        <h3>Step 6: Master the Art of Coffee Dependency</h3>
        <p>
          Coffee isn‚Äôt just a beverage; it‚Äôs a lifestyle. Stock up on coffee
          mugs with witty programming jokes and wear your caffeine addiction
          like a badge of honor. Real developers have caffeine in their veins.

        <h3>Step 7: Spend Hours Perfecting Your Dark Mode Setup</h3>
        <p>
          Nothing boosts productivity like the perfect dark mode theme. Spend at
          least 3 hours configuring your IDE‚Äôs theme, terminal color scheme, and
          installing useless extensions. But hey, at least it looks cool!

        <h3>Step 8: Panic When You See 'Merge Conflicts'</h3>
        <p>
          There‚Äôs nothing more terrifying than those two words: 'Merge
          Conflicts'. Every seasoned engineer knows the best way to deal with
          them is to pull the latest master branch, break everything, and then
          leave it for Future You to fix.

        <h3>Step 9: Create a Personal Website You Never Finish</h3>
        <p>
          Every developer needs a personal website. Start strong, pick a trendy
          JavaScript framework, and abandon the project halfway through. Who
          needs a portfolio anyway? Your half-finished site will speak volumes.

        <h3>
          Step 10: Apply to Jobs Asking for 5+ Years of Experience in
          Technologies That Are 2 Years Old
        </h3>
        <p>
          Job hunting is an art form. Look for positions demanding absurd
          experience in new tech. Apply, get rejected, repeat. It‚Äôs not about
          finding the right job; it‚Äôs about building character (or something
          like that).
